        I'm a final year Computer Science student who is passionate about
        learning. Currently I am learning web dev and this is my first real
        website. I hope to be able to come out of this quarantine with a new
        skillset and with something to showcase my growth. I am interested in
        streetwear, high-end fashion, sneakers, aftermarket car modifications,
        and most recently, cycling. Thank you for thaking the time to visit my
        website.
