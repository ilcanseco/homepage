            I'm a final year Computer Science student who is passionate about
            learning. Currently I am learning web dev and this is my first real
            website. I hope to be able to come out of this quarantine with a new
            skillset and with something to showcase my growth. I am interested
            in streetwear, high-end fashion, sneakers, aftermarket car
            modifications, and most recently, cycling. Thank you for thaking the
            time to visit my website.
