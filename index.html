            I'm a  recently graduated Computer Science student who is passionate about
            learning. Currently I am actively looking for new projects to work on to
            develop my skillset. I hope to be able to come out of this quarantine with 
            something to showcase my growth. I am interested in streetwear, high-end 
            fashion, sneakers, aftermarket car modifications, and most recently, cycling.
